# Puzzlify
Beginner interactive coding challenges without sign up!

## Inspiration

When we brainstormed applications for a text editor, I was inspired by my daily use of interactive web python editors like Leetcode, Replit, and Codeacademy. Furthermore, I then reflected on how difficult it was to solve Leetcode challenges at first due to the higher user expectations.

## What it does

It gives challenges that can be solved by the newest coders.

## How we built it

We used TinyMCE's amazing editor and plugins to enable users to effectively write and compile code

## Challenges we ran into

Most of our challenges revolved around getting JavaScript to interpret the HTML output of TinyMCE into text that can then be ran through our runtime object

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are most proud of how we formatted our site, and how easy and intuitive it is to start solving challenges.

## What we learned

We learned a lot on dynamic elements within javascript, and on running python instances safely.

## What's next for Puzzlify

We strongly believe that Puzzlify can be widely adopted after more development to educate beginners on skills, allowing a solid understanding deeper into the path of computer science.
